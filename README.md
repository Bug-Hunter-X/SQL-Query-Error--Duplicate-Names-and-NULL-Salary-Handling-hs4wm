This repository contains a SQL query that demonstrates potential errors related to duplicate names and NULL values in the 'salary' column.  The `bug.sql` file shows the original query, while `bugSolution.sql` provides a corrected version that addresses these issues. The corrected version uses a unique identifier for the employees (e.g., employee ID) to avoid ambiguity and explicitly handles NULL salaries using the IS NOT NULL condition.
